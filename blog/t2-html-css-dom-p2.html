                  <h3>What is Grid Based Design?</h3>
                  <p>A grid-based design is one that works in and around the constraints of a row-and-column-based grid system to help keep web content nicely aligned.</p>
                  <p>The human eye 'sees' a web page a certain way, roughly from the top left to the bottom right, the grid will guide the user eyes to see elements in a pleasing and distinctive way. </p>

                  <h3>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
                  <p>With the increased users on smart phones and tablets, this is a logical solution for those who do not want to invest in various versions of a website for all those different devices.</p>
                  <p>A responsive website is designed based on a flexible grid and it would scale automatically to fit accordingly to any screen resolution.</p>
                  <p>Depending on the screen resolution, some contents can be positioned accordingly for easier navigation.</p>

                  <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
                  <p>Semantic structure means writing your website in a clean and descriptive html markup tags.</p>
                  <p>Many visual impaired people rely on text to speech program to read webpages back to them, semantic code aids accessibility.</p>
                  <p>It also helps to improves the ranking of a website in a search engine as it is easier for the "search engine spiders" to understand your contents.

                  <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
                  <p>After completing the 2 lessons on Udacity, I have a better understanding in how to break down a design mockup into page elements and turn them into html and css codes.</p>
                  <p>I also learned the importance of grid based and responsive designs, hopefully I would be able to redesign my homepage with these concepts.</p>
