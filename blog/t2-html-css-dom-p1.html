           <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
           <p>They are like a Christmas tree, you have the html which is the root and structure of the tree, CSS is the bell and ornaments you put on the tree as decorators,  the DOM is the representation of this tree and its various branches (so you can target children and parents of each of those areas).</p>

           <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
           <p>Basically it means to design your webpage in boxes, every element in a webpage can be divided into rectangulars, including the shapes like buttons and rounded corners.</p>

           <h3> What is the box model?</h3>
           <p>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.</p>
