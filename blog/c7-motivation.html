                        <h3>Pleasure, Passion and Purpose' in life</h3>
                        <p>Pleasure is that "instant gratification" feeling people always pursuing in life, this type of happiness is the most fleeting and short lasting and “as soon as the source of stimuli goes away, people’s happiness drops immediately”.</p>
                        <p>Passion is described as a "flow", it’s when you are “in the zone” and so utterly absorbed in what you are doing that hours seem to fly by like minutes and before you know it when you take a second to look up and step away from what you are doing you realize it is four hours late. This type of happiness is significantly more lasting than the pleasure type of happiness.</p>
                        <p>Purpose is described as serving a higher purpose and feeling connected to something larger and more powerful than yourself. Of course, is this the “highest” form of happiness and also the longest lasting.</p>
                        <p>From my understanding, in order to achieve the utmost happiness in life, we need to find our passion and devote our time in doing something we love and ultimately we become really good in it and then finding ourselves contributing to a greater cause. Pleasure is like an occasional treat to us but it's not the main goal of life.</p>
                        <h3>My Core Values and I stand for in life</h3>
                        <p>Hope - No matter how life turns upside down, hope is what keeps me going, good things will be just around the corner.</p>
                        <p>Honesty & Integrity - No cheating, stealing, or deceiving in anyway. Thinking and doing what is right at all times.</p>
                        <p>Kindness - Be generous and considerate, always giving out a helping hand to needy people</p>
                        <h3>Resilience</h3>
                        <p>I like this word, it reminded me of video games where warriors wearing heavy armour with high durability, they can sustain heavy damages inflicted on them. So the more resilience you have, you are tougher and hard to be taken down. Whatever difficulties or obstacles that we face in our lives, we just have to beef up ourselves and driving a "tank" through it. </p>
