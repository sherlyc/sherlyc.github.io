                  <h3> What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
                  <p> I'm quite happy I take the plunge to sign up with EDA, so far everything has been positive for me. </p>
                  <h3> What are your impressions?</h3>
                  <p> It's all good and I'm glad that I get to learn with a group of people who works toward a common goal. I could see where my fellow classmates are up to with the waffle board, this has been keeping me in check with my course work. </p>
                  <h3> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
                  <p> Well, I am pushing myself to participate in the group chat as much as I can, getting to know my fellow classmates, also trying to help as much as I can because I believe learning is best when you are teaching someone else.</p>
                  <h3> Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
                  <p> Not really. I have done my research before signing up so I'm glad that EDA is delivering what they promised. </p>
                  <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
                  <p> Yes, I'm a little nervous. I'm a shy person and hopefully by the end of this bootcamp, I will learn to express myself comfortably, develop active listening skill and becoming a good NZ cultural fit. </p>
