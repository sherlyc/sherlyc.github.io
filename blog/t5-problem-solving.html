                          <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
                        </div>
                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>So that night, I was reading through the chapter 2 and had fun completing the challenges until I arrived at the chess board challenge and it was where I spent over 3 hours STUCKED! It was 2am in the morning, my head was literally going to explode when the program didn't act the way I wanted. There was no error messages so there's no way to trace the error, just couldn't seen to get the function to print the pattern in the right order.</p>
                        <h3>Did I solve it?</h3>
                        <p>Not wanting to give up although my bed was inviting, I decided to Try Something! By making small changes to the code and see what happens! After checking for a few times, I suspected my modulo function is the culprit then I GOOGLE for modulo function example and after some researching I can conclude that my modulo formula was wrong.</p>
                        <h3>How did I feel?</h3>
                        <p>Having stucked at a code that didn't work as intended for hours was a daunting experience to me. A part of me wanted to solve the problem and move on quickly. I kept on working on the problem and didn't realize the time flies by. I should have timeboxed it for like an hour and not delve into the problem over time. Should have looked up for ideas by Googling or asked for peer's help. </p>
                        <h3>My Takes on The Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
                        <p>Pseudocode - this is a great way to plan out the program before we write the coding. Saves time and keep us on track. </p>
                        <p>Trying something - I love this, it's a effective way to solve a problem when you are not sure which part of program got wrong, you make small changes and see what happens. Then change something else and see where it leads you. </p>
                        <p>Rubber Duck - If you explain your problem to someone and you will usually discover the problem before someone gives you the solution. I don't usually have someone around me to speak up my problem with, so I will take a walk and have a talk to myself. I love this approach as I found that if I coupled this with walking meditation, my mind is clearer and I usually have a solution by the end of the walk. </p>
                        <p>Reading Error Message - Javascript error message is notorious for not having a clear explanation of the problem, I had to resort to Googling most of the time to figure out the error message.</p>
                        <p>Console Logging - One of my favourite method to track and catch an error, it could be tedious if the program is big and you need to deal with multiple console logging.</p>
                        <p>Googling - I don't know how to live without it. Anything can be found online, I found some helpful insights at the StackOverflow which is very helpful while learning to code.</p>
                        <p>Asking for peers for help - I have not resorted to this, but I will if all the above methods failed.</p>
                        <p>Asking coaches for help - Have not tried this, but I think I would need a lot of these during phase 1.</p>
                        <p>Reminder to myself : stick to the timeboxing and don't follow the white rabbit!</p>
                        <p>.map() - imagine you have a bunch of kids(array) going to barber. They would all come out with their hair trimmed. HairTrim is the function.</p>
                        <p>kids.map(hairTrim) //each kid gets their hair trimmed</p>
                        <p>.filter() - send a group of drivers to do Alcohol Test, only a couple of drivers who passed the test will return.</p>
                        <p>drivers.filter(AlcoholTest) //only return a few drivers who passed the test</p>
                        <p>.reduce() - imagine you have a few of coins [10, 20, 5] and you want to add them all up.</p>
                        <div class="blkCode">
                          var sum = [10, 20, 5].reduce(
                          function(total, num){ return total + num }
                          , 0);

                          sum will return 35.
                        </div>
                        <p>You can also use it to reduce an array of string and combine them into a single variable of strings.</p>
