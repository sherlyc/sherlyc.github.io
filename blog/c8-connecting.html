                        <h3> Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
                        <p>Have found Just Like Me practice pretty useful over the week. When meeting team mates at the EDA, I found them not as intimidating as before. I am a shy person and always found myself not knowing what to say or not saying the right thing when meeting someone new. This practice helps reminding me, everybody, every single person and being at an essential level is just like me. </p>
                        <h3> Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
                        <p>Have tried interacting with someone who I'm having difficulties, by listening more, I found that we are having a pleasant conversation now. It used to be we are always in a disagreement. I also had a case of having a kid who threw tantrum calmed down, just because of listening to her empathically and have her feelings in check.</p>
                        <h3> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
                        <p>Loving-kindness meditation, is about opening up the heart and cultivating love and compassion for ourselves and others. The way most of us live our lives we’re constantly striving to serve ourselves. We’re trying to find peace and happiness and we believe that by living to fulfill our own wishes and desires that we’ll accomplish that. </p>
                        <p>But the wisdom of the world tells us differently. Everywhere from Buddhism to Hinduism, to Christianity, Judaism and Islam repeat this very same idea.</p><p> "Love all beings. Treat them as you would treat yourself".</p>
                        <p>If we look to Buddhist wisdom we see an unbroken lineage of practitioners, from the Buddha all the way to the present-day Dalai Lama, who have used loving-kindness meditation to transform their mind, open up their heart, and realize the true way- that the path to happiness is through selflessness.</p>
                        <p>When we nurture our mind we become a limitless beacon of light for others to feed off of, and in this way, our peace and happiness helps others find peace and happiness as well. ~source: buddhaimonia</p>
