                        <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
                        <p>It helps to keep me in track and making sure I don't delve too deep in minor cosmetic things like fixing spaces and playing with the typography and colours. If I spent too much time in these things, I wouldn't managed to finish my goal on time.</p>
                        <h3>Some thoughts after reading Chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself</h3>
                        <p>Never have I thought that meditation is so easy and it seems like if I could mastered meditation, it would help me in every aspect of life. I am thrilled!</p>
                        <p>I tend to get stressed easily and I have the tendency to run away from problem instead of facing it. With the help of meditation, I can learn to manage my stress, overcome my fear and achieve happiness.</p>
                        <p>One of the techniques mentioned in a book is to imagine seeing a butterfly resting on a flower with a gentle breeze (our breaths) lifting and lower it. I love it and found it a great aid in improving my concentration</p>
                        <p>I also love the idea of seeing myself in the loving eyes of grandmother, I will try to practise it. Thank you for your attention.</p>
