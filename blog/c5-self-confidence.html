                        <h3>The relationship between mindfulness and self awareness</h3>
                        <p>Mindfulness is the process of observing what your mind is thinking or saying. Awareness is the separate process of being conscious of what your senses of touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing are picking up from the world around you. Once your senses pick up something they send the information to your mind to work out what you should do or not do about what they are informing you about.</p>
                        <h3>Body Scan</h3>
                        <p>Body scan is one of the self awareness practice that I tried. I felt that each part of my body is becoming lighter and relaxed. After the session, I felt that my mind is so much revived and restful.</p>
                        <h3>My Emotions are not Me</h3>
                        <p>If I am not my emotions, then when I sense these things arising, I can let them go, just as easily as they arose. The more I let go of them as they occur, the less power they have over me, and the more they start to disappear. The more they disappear, the calmer my life becomes.</p>
