The first 20km are paved asphalt but then turns into a single lane dirt road with significant cliff-side drops.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The group is believed to have been made up of 12 riders, plus two guides and a support vehicle.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to Matthews, the ride is broken up into 12 or 13 sections of up to 5km each.</p> \n<p>Guides were made aware of the accident after the man did not arrive at one of the prescribed stops, at which point they rode back up the road and identified where he had fallen off the road.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The lead guide abseiled&nbsp;down to where he had fallen, about 100 metres below the road, and determined that there was no sign of life.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The man's body&nbsp;has been since recovered with the help of local authorities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Matthews said that the conditions had been wet, but not out of the ordinary.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"It had been raining, and the rain had just begun to pick up at the time, but I wouldn't say it was torrential. That would be fairly typical conditions at this time of year.\"</p> \n<p>Another New Zealand woman, who was travelling with the&nbsp;man, also sustained&nbsp;facial injuries, though Matthews confirmed that they were sustained around 20 minutes prior, in a separate incident.</p> \n<p>She crashed on the road but did not go over the edge.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>She is currently hospital in La Paz.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Matthews said that Gravity Bolivia, which was established&nbsp;in 1998 and was the first company to offer cycle tours of the road, had served over 100,000 customers and this was the first death they had ever had due to accident or crash.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They had previously had one other customer die on the road, who Matthews said was an \"older American gentleman\", after he suffered a heart attack.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There were about 30 companies offering cycle tours of the road, and he estimated there had been about 30 deaths on the road since 1998.</p> \n<p>\"It almost seems ridiculous in this day and age, but it's one of those things where it's not clear, but it's probably around 30. Bolivia being Bolivia, some businesses pay to have these things vanished.\"</p> \n<p>He said that he had attempted to pass a minimum safety standard regulation across all tour operators, but it was never implemented due to \"considerable resistance from some companies.\"</p> \n<p>He said Gravity Bolivia was going through an investigation to determine that their safety standards were up to scratch said he was \"confident\" in their quality.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade&nbsp;spokesperson said they were aware of the death and were providing consular support to his partner and&nbsp;family.&nbsp;MFAT&nbsp;would not provide any details on the incident, citing privacy reasons.</p>",

Every news that were brought upon us since his last op was devastating with little signs of hope on his recovery. We all broke down when the medical team spoke to us that his condition is worsening and we should be prepared for the worst. We're going to lose a brother. And my parents are going to lose their precious son whom is only 28. Thus I seek everybody's kind understanding that we are unable to comment further during these precarious time.</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aloypang/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> 冯伟衷 Aloysius Pang</a> (@aloypang) on <time datetime=\"2019-01-23T15:35:10+00:00\" style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\">Jan 23, 2019 at 7:35am PST</time></p> \n  </div> \n </blockquote> \n <script async src=\"http://www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n</div> \n<p>Pang was doing repairs inside the Howitzer, a motorised piece of artillery that looks similar to a small tank, when he was injured, the ministry said.</p> \n<p>The New Zealand Defence Force said its soldiers were not involved when the incident occurred.</p> \n<p>\"The soldier was taking part in Exercise Thunder Warrior which is an annual live-firing exercise held in Waiouru,\" a Defence spokeswoman said.</p> \n<p>\"The New Zealand Defence Force hosts Exercise Thunder Warrior and provides administrative support and liaison officers but was not taking part in this year's exercise.\"</p> \n<p>A medical officer at Waiouru assessed him&nbsp;around 2:30pm on Saturday, before he was sent to the Waiouru Camp Medical Centre for further treatment.</p> \n<p>By 4:10pm, the Singapore Defence Ministry said a helicopter had arrived to take Pang to hospital, where he spent more than five and a half hours in surgery.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;Singapore Armed Forces was&nbsp;making arrangements to have his body brought back home.</p> \n<p>Pang was known for his work in the films&nbsp;<em>Young &amp; Fabulous, Timeless Love,&nbsp;</em>and an assortment of TV series.&nbsp;</p>",
