That's still a ways away but we're looking toward getting there eventually.\"</p> \n<p>Escaping the American winter at their Rhode Island base to sail in the sunny south at Pensacola has allowed American&nbsp;Magic to get some real momentum to the famous New York club's return to Cup racing.</p> \n<p>\"This has been a new class, a very new concept, and we've obviously got a huge list of things to work our way through,\" Barker said.</p> \n<p>\"Pretty much every day there's something to learn and so it's really valuable for the team as a whole to be able to go through the process of getting the boat on the water every day. We get the good part to be able to sail it.\"</p> \n<p>Andrew Campbell, who joined American Magic from the now defunct Oracle Team USA to stay involved in the&nbsp;Cup game, talked up the Florida conditions.</p> \n<p>\"Pensacola has completely exceeded expectations,\" Campbell said.</p> \n<p>\"Flat water, plenty of breeze, hasn't been too cold and people are good here. They've treated us really well. It's just a nice big racetrack where we can stretch out and do everything we need to do testing wise but it's challenging enough that it keeps us keep us on our toes. We couldn't be any happier to be here.</p> \n<p>\"The 38 (test boat) is our best shot at getting a feel for what the pain points are going to be around the racetrack.</p> \n<p>\"We're trying to put ourselves under pressure every day to make sure that we're learning the hard points of sail and the hard corners, so this boat been a great tool for that.\"</p> \n<p>American Magic are due to relocate to Rhode Island later in May.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Education Minister Chris Hipkins&nbsp;has said anti-vaxxers are \"pro-plague\" as pleas are made to parents to vaccinate their children amid a measles outbreak.</p> \n<p>In Northland, the district health board has asked that schools consider telling unimmunised children to stay at home.&nbsp; The immunisation rate in the region is about 86 per cent.</p> \n<p>\"Those people who are anti-vaccination are pro plague. It is a ridiculous position, it is not based on science,\" he said.</p> \n<p>\"There are very good reasons why we require a certain level of the population to be immunised,so we are not susceptible to massive outbreaks and where those people arguing against it on non-science&nbsp;are basically irresponsible.\"</p> \n<p><strong>READ MORE:<br> * <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/98414734/antivaxxers-delusional-and-dangerous?rm=a\">Anti-vaxxers 'delusional' and 'dangerous'</a><br> * <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/parenting/baby/caring-for-baby/81086781/i-now-view-antivaxxers-as-sort-of-a-cult?rm=a\">'I now view anti-vaxxers as sort of a cult'</a></strong></p> \n<p>The DHB needed to step up in terms of their responsibility to ensure that the Northland population does have sufficient levels of immunisation and clearly there was an issue there, he said.</p> \n<p>\"I don't believe that kids should be denied their right to an education, particularly if it's a conscious&nbsp;choice by their parents not to immunise. These are the kids who most deserve to learn about science.</p> \n<p>\"Kids should not be excluded from their education because their parents are pro-plague.\"</p> \n<p>When Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was asked about Hipkins pro-plague comment, she said she could see why he felt strongly about it.</p> \n<p>\"Our sentiment and sense of feeling on this is exactly the same. We&nbsp;have modern medicine to try and protect kids from illnesses that can cause grave damage, even death, we should use it.\"</p> \n<p>\"I think the minister is making the point that if you don't vaccinate,&nbsp;you put others at risk and that's unfortunately true.\"</p> \n<p>When asked if the kids should be kept away from school she said that was not the way to try and protect children.</p> \n<p>\"We want them all to be in school. Ultimately the best protection is vaccination. We have got to make sure that DHBs are focused on reaching as many children as possible.</p> \n<p>\"One of the unfortunate things I feel like I've seen over the last couple of years is this misinformation. Parents want to do the best by their kids&nbsp;but when there is so much false information that vaccines aren't&nbsp;safe, that's incredibly damaging.</p> \n<p>\"Parents I just encourage you please vaccinate your children, there are so many horror stories out there. It is the best protection we can provide.\"</p> \n<p>Health Minister DavidClark said anti-vaxxers needed to be challenged and he had a strong view that people need to get vaccinations.</p> \n<p>\"I think children should not be punished for the decisions of their parents. Those children in particular need access to science probably more than most.</p> \n<p>\"I do have serious concerns with people that put others at risk … the science is very clear about the benefits of vaccination and some of these diseases are deadly.\"</p> \n<p>Northland DHB needed to do better with its immunisation rates and he wants to see a plan from them that they will lift rates.</p> \n<p>\"It alarms me when I hear stories of 200 kids at a school are not being immunised.\"</p> \n<p>He said keeping kids at home was something that might be reserved for an outbreak.</p> \n<p>He had been advised the two recent cases in Northland had come in from overseas and were not related to the New Zealand cases already.</p> \n<p>\"It does not take away from the seriousness that we lift our immunisation rates.\"</p>",

That's still a ways away but we're looking toward getting there eventually.\"</p> \n<p>Escaping the American winter at their Rhode Island base to sail in the sunny south at Pensacola has allowed American&nbsp;Magic to get some real momentum to the famous New York club's return to Cup racing.</p> \n<p>\"This has been a new class, a very new concept, and we've obviously got a huge list of things to work our way through,\" Barker said.</p> \n<p>\"Pretty much every day there's something to learn and so it's really valuable for the team as a whole to be able to go through the process of getting the boat on the water every day. We get the good part to be able to sail it.\"</p> \n<p>Andrew Campbell, who joined American Magic from the now defunct Oracle Team USA to stay involved in the&nbsp;Cup game, talked up the Florida conditions.</p> \n<p>\"Pensacola has completely exceeded expectations,\" Campbell said.</p> \n<p>\"Flat water, plenty of breeze, hasn't been too cold and people are good here. They've treated us really well. It's just a nice big racetrack where we can stretch out and do everything we need to do testing wise but it's challenging enough that it keeps us keep us on our toes. We couldn't be any happier to be here.</p> \n<p>\"The 38 (test boat) is our best shot at getting a feel for what the pain points are going to be around the racetrack.</p> \n<p>\"We're trying to put ourselves under pressure every day to make sure that we're learning the hard points of sail and the hard corners, so this boat been a great tool for that.\"</p> \n<p>American Magic are due to relocate to Rhode Island later in May.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Education Minister Chris Hipkins&nbsp;has said anti-vaxxers are \"pro-plague\" as pleas are made to parents to vaccinate their children amid a measles outbreak.</p> \n<p>In Northland, the district health board has asked that schools consider telling unimmunised children to stay at home.&nbsp; The immunisation rate in the region is about 86 per cent.</p> \n<p>\"Those people who are anti-vaccination are pro plague. It is a ridiculous position, it is not based on science,\" he said.</p> \n<p>\"There are very good reasons why we require a certain level of the population to be immunised,so we are not susceptible to massive outbreaks and where those people arguing against it on non-science&nbsp;are basically irresponsible.\"</p> \n<p><strong>READ MORE:<br> * <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/98414734/antivaxxers-delusional-and-dangerous?rm=a\">Anti-vaxxers 'delusional' and 'dangerous'</a><br> * <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/parenting/baby/caring-for-baby/81086781/i-now-view-antivaxxers-as-sort-of-a-cult?rm=a\">'I now view anti-vaxxers as sort of a cult'</a></strong></p> \n<p>The DHB needed to step up in terms of their responsibility to ensure that the Northland population does have sufficient levels of immunisation and clearly there was an issue there, he said.</p> \n<p>\"I don't believe that kids should be denied their right to an education, particularly if it's a conscious&nbsp;choice by their parents not to immunise. These are the kids who most deserve to learn about science.</p> \n<p>\"Kids should not be excluded from their education because their parents are pro-plague.\"</p> \n<p>When Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was asked about Hipkins pro-plague comment, she said she could see why he felt strongly about it.</p> \n<p>\"Our sentiment and sense of feeling on this is exactly the same. We&nbsp;have modern medicine to try and protect kids from illnesses that can cause grave damage, even death, we should use it.\"</p> \n<p>\"I think the minister is making the point that if you don't vaccinate,&nbsp;you put others at risk and that's unfortunately true.\"</p> \n<p>When asked if the kids should be kept away from school she said that was not the way to try and protect children.</p> \n<p>\"We want them all to be in school. Ultimately the best protection is vaccination. We have got to make sure that DHBs are focused on reaching as many children as possible.</p> \n<p>\"One of the unfortunate things I feel like I've seen over the last couple of years is this misinformation. Parents want to do the best by their kids&nbsp;but when there is so much false information that vaccines aren't&nbsp;safe, that's incredibly damaging.</p> \n<p>\"Parents I just encourage you please vaccinate your children, there are so many horror stories out there. It is the best protection we can provide.\"</p> \n<p>Health Minister DavidClark said anti-vaxxers needed to be challenged and he had a strong view that people need to get vaccinations.</p> \n<p>\"I think children should not be punished for the decisions of their parents. Those children in particular need access to science probably more than most.</p> \n<p>\"I do have serious concerns with people that put others at risk … the science is very clear about the benefits of vaccination and some of these diseases are deadly.\"</p> \n<p>Northland DHB needed to do better with its immunisation rates and he wants to see a plan from them that they will lift rates.</p> \n<p>\"It alarms me when I hear stories of 200 kids at a school are not being immunised.\"</p> \n<p>He said keeping kids at home was something that might be reserved for an outbreak.</p> \n<p>He had been advised the two recent cases in Northland had come in from overseas and were not related to the New Zealand cases already.</p> \n<p>\"It does not take away from the seriousness that we lift our immunisation rates.\"</p>",
