It's all about the safety of the children. And they were warned about the unrestrained children,\" Senior Sergeant Gill Meadows said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The family didn't get a fine on top of purchasing the seats.</p> \n<p>The family first came to the attention of the New Zealand public last week after allegedly <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/109907273/tourists-leave-rubbish-get-aggressive-at-auckland-beach?rm=m\" target=\"_blank\">leaving beer boxes, bottles and baby wipes</a> at Takapuna Beach. It was then alleged they had dined and dashed at an Indian restaurant and bar in Northcote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Immigration New Zealand said Deportation Liability Notices (DLN) were served on individuals involved in the incident at the Burger King restaurant.</p> \n<p>\"Section 157(5) of the Immigration Act 2009 provides for temporary visa holders to be issued with a DLN on a number of grounds, including matters relating to character,\"&nbsp; Peter Devoy, Assistant General Manager INZ said in a statement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"Immigration officers advised the individuals of their appeal rights and provided the relevant documentation for them to appeal if they choose to do so.\"</p> \n<p>Those issued with the DLN notice have 28 days to appeal the notice.&nbsp; They are also allowed to leave of their own choice before the notice period.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Speaking to reporters outside the Burger King, one family member said they would be going home on Wednesday.</p>",

We can mechanise a lot of the work, but we can't mechanise a person on a spade,\"&nbsp;Janett&nbsp;said.</p> \n<p>Tree planting was done in autumn and winter and seasonal workers from the Pacific Islands would need to be recruited.</p> \n<p>Forest Nursery Growers Association president Kevin&nbsp;Haine&nbsp;said its member nurseries would grow 100 million tree seedlings&nbsp;this year, almost double the&nbsp;54m&nbsp;trees grown two years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of this, the Government was responsible for about 20m trees through its Crown&nbsp;forestry partnerships, such&nbsp;as its agreement&nbsp;to&nbsp;establish a commercial forest on Ngati Rehia iwi land in Northland.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Tree planting&nbsp;had already&nbsp;increased to 70m trees last year in response to&nbsp;demand for replanting of harvested forests, as the \"wall of wood\" from a peak planting in 1994 reached maturity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"A positive aspect is that&nbsp;all the logged land is being replanted in trees. This is in contrast to about&nbsp;five years ago when carbon credits were low and&nbsp;it was cheap to get out of forestry and into farming.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>​Pinus&nbsp;radiata remained the predominant&nbsp;species, making up about 90 per cent of forest plantings. \"It is a quick growing tree&nbsp;with good wood density and characteristics.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Eucalyptus and Douglas fir were also grown, with demand increasing for redwood.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nursery growers were aware that a change of government might&nbsp;lead to a change in tree-planting policy, which had occurred before, so were wary of gearing up too quickly,&nbsp;Haine&nbsp;said. \"The contracts signed have only been for one year. The Government&nbsp;hasn't signed any long-term contracts, so it's year-by-year.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"However, for nurseries to scale up is reasonably doable,\" said&nbsp;Haine,&nbsp;nursery manager at PF Olsen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Patrick Murray, of Murrays Nurseries at Woodville, said it had doubled&nbsp;plantings of&nbsp;pinus&nbsp;radiata from&nbsp;5m to 10m trees in the last year, with Crown Forestry contracting a lot of the trees. This surpassed its previous peak production of 9.3m trees in the early 1990s.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Murray said that while the operation could expand further, he had turned down further business in the meantime as he was cautious about having sufficient staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>​Janett said the surge in tree planting meant landowners needed to consider scale, or face not being able to harvest their&nbsp;commercial plantation forests.</p> \n<p>There was already a shortage of forest harvest contractors in the North Island, who could chose to only&nbsp;log forests with scale and good access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Government was offering $118 million in direct landholder grants to encourage the planting of trees,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;native regeneration.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Landowners had&nbsp;to decide whether a forest would&nbsp;be for production or permanent. If planting for timber they needed scale,&nbsp;Janett&nbsp;said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"Don't plant a five hectare woodlot and think loggers will turn up in 25-or-30 years and make you money as they won't. Don't plant five hectares&nbsp;at the back of the farm and expect loggers to turn up.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Forest loggers&nbsp;had significant capital set-up costs and needed to meet increasingly stringent health and safety and environmental compliance.</p> \n<p>Contractors logged&nbsp;and transported timber&nbsp;in all weather conditions \"so the days of a mud track are long gone. It's only going to get harder in terms of regulation&nbsp;and physically finding&nbsp;people to turn up and do the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"In&nbsp;parts of the&nbsp;North Island, there are huge amounts of wood to harvest&nbsp;and we cannot&nbsp;physically get contractors to come and harvest it. Contractors can choose&nbsp;the biggest and most well set-up block with the easiest access.</p> \n<p>\"In 25 years, there will&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;be 50ha to 100ha blocks everywhere that need harvesting&nbsp;with the new planting grants and potential Emissions Trading Scheme&nbsp;changes,\"&nbsp;Janett&nbsp;said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Returns were about 5&nbsp;to 6 per cent a year for timber only, and 9&nbsp;to 10 per cent if carbon credits from ETS&nbsp;were added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ollie Belton,&nbsp;a partner of Permanent Forests NZ&nbsp;a Christchurch-based carbon consultancy, said ETS rule changes would make permanent forests more attractive by removing the liability risk. Permanent forests could keep earning carbon credits under ETS as long as a&nbsp;forest kept growing and gaining biomass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Under existing&nbsp;rules the risk was that as trees aged and blew over, those carbon credits would need to be paid back. Proposed&nbsp;rules removed this liability&nbsp;if the forest was replanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"So this eliminates the risk of liability from a fire or a wind event and forest owners won't need carbon insurance.\"</p> \n<p>Belton said he wanted landowners to think about a long-term&nbsp;time-frame. \"This could&nbsp;initially involve planting eucalyptus&nbsp;and&nbsp;pinus&nbsp;radiata, then later introducing natives so that in 100 to 200 years it is a mixed species forest.\"&nbsp;</p>",
