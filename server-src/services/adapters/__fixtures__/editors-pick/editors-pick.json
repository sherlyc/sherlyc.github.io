Surely if the owners gave them those numbers, they must be entitled to some sort of compensation?</p> \n<p>No, they are not, because the contracts and the current legislation are structured in a way which protects the farm owners and not the little guy.</p> \n<p>Not the guy who has put his family's whole livelihood on the line. Not the guy who&nbsp;has workers depending on him to pay them on time. Not the guy out in the rain, working long days to keep the farm running.</p> \n<p>What rights does he have? None. He can lose everything. Because he is not an employee, he has no employment rights, so he does not get holiday pay&nbsp;or weekends off.</p> \n<p>He does not have the right to subcontract out his job&nbsp;or determine how performs his duties.</p> \n<p>When you <a href=\"https://www.otago.ac.nz/humanresources/otago666833.pdf\">look at the difference between an independent contractor and an employee</a>, you can see that contract and lower order sharemilking is a grey area that falls&nbsp;into both categories.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That being the case, we need a complete overhaul. We need rights.</p> \n<p>We need to be able to expect to be paid for our work, regardless of whether or not that person has the skills or ability to guess what his power bill will be.</p> \n<p>He should not have to have his spouse work every weekend, holiday and public holiday just to earn his expected wage.</p> \n<p>This is the dark side of dairy and the industry cannot afford to lose these young, energetic and passionate people.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We are better than that.&nbsp; We pride ourselves on being the backbone of this country.</p> \n<p>Do we not as a community gather together and support each other, share our knowledge with one another?&nbsp;Help one another when our neighbour is in trouble?</p> \n<p>Even if we have no legal obligation right now, surely we have a moral obligation to our new generation of farmers to give them the opportunity to make their mark on our industry.</p> \n<p>We are asking&nbsp;– demanding – that the legislation and contracts are changed so these farmers have the chance&nbsp;they deserve to provide for their families and continue to grow our industry.</p> \n<p>Let's leave this dark side of dairy behind us once and for all.</p>",
