Surely if the owners gave them those numbers, they must be entitled to some sort of compensation?</p> \n<p>No, they are not, because the contracts and the current legislation are structured in a way which protects the farm owners and not the little guy.</p> \n<p>Not the guy who has put his family's whole livelihood on the line. Not the guy who&nbsp;has workers depending on him to pay them on time. Not the guy out in the rain, working long days to keep the farm running.</p> \n<p>What rights does he have? None. He can lose everything. Because he is not an employee, he has no employment rights, so he does not get holiday pay&nbsp;or weekends off.</p> \n<p>He does not have the right to subcontract out his job&nbsp;or determine how performs his duties.</p> \n<p>When you <a href=\"https://www.otago.ac.nz/humanresources/otago666833.pdf\">look at the difference between an independent contractor and an employee</a>, you can see that contract and lower order sharemilking is a grey area that falls&nbsp;into both categories.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That being the case, we need a complete overhaul. We need rights.</p> \n<p>We need to be able to expect to be paid for our work, regardless of whether or not that person has the skills or ability to guess what his power bill will be.</p> \n<p>He should not have to have his spouse work every weekend, holiday and public holiday just to earn his expected wage.</p> \n<p>This is the dark side of dairy and the industry cannot afford to lose these young, energetic and passionate people.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We are better than that.&nbsp; We pride ourselves on being the backbone of this country.</p> \n<p>Do we not as a community gather together and support each other, share our knowledge with one another?&nbsp;Help one another when our neighbour is in trouble?</p> \n<p>Even if we have no legal obligation right now, surely we have a moral obligation to our new generation of farmers to give them the opportunity to make their mark on our industry.</p> \n<p>We are asking&nbsp;– demanding – that the legislation and contracts are changed so these farmers have the chance&nbsp;they deserve to provide for their families and continue to grow our industry.</p> \n<p>Let's leave this dark side of dairy behind us once and for all.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>OPINION: </strong>There is a casual arrogance to ANZ NZ chairman John Key's handling of the David Hisco affair.</p> \n<p>And it complements, with delicate nuance, the entitlement of the former ANZ NZ chief executive himself.</p> \n<p>At the beginning of last week <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113536338/sir-john-key-fronts-media-over-hiscos-departure?rm=a\">Key convened a press conference</a> to announce Hisco's unceremonious departure. The former prime minister was relaxed and self-assured with an easy grasp of the narrative: Hisco was a good man but he had a blind spot.</p> \n<p>Hisco, he said, had obscured personal bills for chauffeur-driven cars and offshore wine cellaring as business expenses. Tens of thousands of dollars had been \"mis-characterised\".</p> \n<p><strong>READ MORE:<br> *<a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113661929/anz-bought-75m-beachside-auckland-property-for-david-hisco\"> ANZ bought $7.5m home for David Hisco</a><br> *&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113599166/anzs-former-boss-david-hisco-clocked-up-nearly-450k-a-year-in-expenses?rm=a\" title=\"\">ANZ's former boss David Hisco clocked up nearly $450k a year in expenses</a><br> *&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113576752/the-smiling-assassin-returns-for-his-biggest-hit?rm=a\" title=\"\">The smiling assassin strikes: John Key pushes out David Hisco as ANZ CEO</a><br> *&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113554814/profits-strikes-settlements-and-huge-paypackets-the-anz-career-of-david-hisco?rm=a\" title=\"\">Profits, strikes, settlements and huge paypackets: The ANZ career of David Hisco</a><br> *&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113553059/key-sold-beach-house-to-hisco-it-was-a-transparent-isue?rm=a\" title=\"\">Sir John Key sold beach house to exiting ANZ boss David Hisco: 'It was a transparent issue'</a></strong></p> \n<p>It was a great pity, but the bank had a \"culture of integrity\" to uphold, Key said. Hisco&nbsp;had agreed to go because he'd fallen short of his own and the bank's standard.</p> \n<p>Blind spots are like that, we all have them, and when someone points them out you simply adjust your perspective, and see what previously you didn't.</p> \n<p>That was the story, clearly agreed by Key and ANZ executives and communications staff.</p> \n<p>But it was a painfully partial story. Key knew that and so did the woman at his side, Antonia Watson, the safe pair of hands into which he'd passed the running of ANZ NZ.</p> \n<p>So did others on the Albert St&nbsp;executive floor.</p> \n<p>Key didn't mention that Hisco's business expense account, reported by the bank as <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113599166/anzs-former-boss-david-hisco-clocked-up-nearly-450k-a-year-in-expenses?rm=a\">\"non monetary benefits\" topped A$464,577 in 2018</a>.</p> \n<p>Nor that the value of those benefits soared more than nine times higher than any other of the bank's executives. But he knew this. He'd been a director of parent ANZ Group since February 2018 and signed off on the annual report that disclosed those figures. Key even sat on the bank's ethics and governance committee.</p> \n<p>To dig any further into the full range of perks Hisco enjoyed, either in 2018, or in the seven previous financial years for which he had held the top ANZ NZ job would blur&nbsp;the narrative.</p> \n<p>And worse, it would make the bank look like a haughty corporation that was out of touch with the everyday Kiwis who formed the customer base for its massive loans portfolios.</p> \n<p>Antonia Watson's knowledge was more specific still.</p> \n<p>Austere, and a little uneasy at Key's side, Watson knew the <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113661929/anz-bought-75m-beachside-auckland-property-for-david-hisco\">details of the St&nbsp;Heliers mansion</a>. In 2017 she was one of three directors of Arawata Assets, a wholly owned subsidiary of ANZ NZ which owned 269 St&nbsp;Heliers Bay Rd, the house where David Hisco and his wife Deborah Walsh had lived since 2011.</p> \n<p>In July of that year Arawata sold the luxury six-bedroom property, complete with tennis court and swimming pool, to Walsh, for an extraordinary $6.9 million, close to $3m below the rateable value of $10.75m.</p> \n<p>Neither Watson nor Key mentioned the \"housing allowance\"&nbsp;Hisco enjoyed for years after he'd bought a $1.7 million dollar apartment in the plush suburb of Kohimarama, within easy reach of his Albert St&nbsp;office in downtown Auckland.<br> <br> If they didn't know about it, others certainly did. Craig Mulholland, ANZ NZ's general counsel at the time of the 2014 purchase was on the title (it was sold in 2016).</p> \n<p>Mulholland is also listed alongside Hisco and Walsh on the <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113553059/key-sold-beach-house-to-hisco-it-was-a-transparent-isue?rm=a\">title of an Omaha beach house</a> they bought from Key in 2018 for an estimated $3.8m.</p> \n<p>But Hisco and Walsh continued to use the St&nbsp;Heliers home as their main residence.</p> \n<p>ANZ also paid for substantial refurbishment of the home in 2015 and 2016, when it replaced the roof, redecorated, renovated the bathrooms, and fixed the spa pool.</p> \n<p>Annis O'Brien knew the details of the property. The ANZ NZ senior executive was appointed director of Arawata in 2016 and remains on the board.</p> \n<p>The story of the St&nbsp;Heliers home is one that ANZ hoped not to tell. And it still hasn't explained how it managed to hold a $7.55m&nbsp;property through the hottest Auckland housing market in living memory and lose money.</p> \n<p>The value of neighbouring properties doubled during that time. It's a bank. Its bread and butter business, on which it makes billions in profits, is mortgages.</p> \n<p>Hisco and his wife appeared to benefit to the tune of nearly $3m from the St&nbsp;Heliers house purchase. Has Hisco or ANZ ever declared that benefit to the IRD?</p> \n<p>ANZ shareholders and the New Zealand public can't look at the accounting for Arawata, and they don't know how it's accounted for.</p> \n<p>Key certainly didn't intend that they should when told a rather quaint fable last week about a banker with a $50,000 blind spot.</p> \n<p>That story is morphing into a saga about a bank and opacity and half-truths. One of the bankers is gone, but at the helm remains a man who is blind to hubris.</p>",
